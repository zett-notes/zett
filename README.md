# Numen

> Divine note-taking for mortal thoughts

Numen is a powerful note-taking app that puts **you** in control. Born as a fork of [Lumen](https://github.com/lumen-notes/lumen), it evolves the concept of personal knowledge management with a focus on privacy, flexibility, and user empowerment.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **📝 Universal Storage** - Store your notes locally or sync with any Git provider (not just GitHub)
- **🔒 Privacy First** - Your thoughts remain yours, with no mandatory cloud dependencies
- **⚡ Lightning Fast** - Blazing fast search and navigation, works offline by default
- **🎨 Beautiful UI** - Clean, modern interface that stays out of your way
- **🔗 Smart Connections** - Discover relationships between your notes organically
- **📱 Cross-Platform** - Access your notes from any device, any time
- **🎯 Markdown Perfect** - True to the Markdown standard, plays nice with other editors

## 🚀 Why Numen?

In ancient Rome, a "numen" was a divine power or spirit believed to inhabit natural objects. Similarly, Numen helps you capture and nurture the divine spark of your ideas.

While Lumen is an excellent note-taking app, Numen takes it further by:
- Removing the GitHub lock-in
- Enhancing Markdown compatibility
- Prioritizing user privacy
- Adding flexible storage options
- Improving cross-editor compatibility
