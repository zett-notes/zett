# Zett

A personal note-taking app that helps you maintain calm and mindful life.

Born as a fork of [Lumen](https://github.com/lumen-notes/lumen), Zett evolves the concept with focus on user freedom and simplicity.

## Core Principles

- Your notes are yours (plain Markdown files)
- Local-first, always offline
- No vendor lock-in
- True to Markdown standard
- Fast and distraction-free

## Status

Early development. Building the foundations.

## Philosophy

In a world of constant information overflow, good note-taking is the antidote to chaos. Zett aims to be a clean, focused tool that helps you stay in command of your knowledge, rather than being overwhelmed by it.
