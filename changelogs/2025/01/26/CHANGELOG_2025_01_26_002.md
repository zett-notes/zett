### [FIX] Development Mode Git Clone CORS Issue

#### Before
Git clone operations failed in development mode due to CORS issues:

```typescript:src/utils/git.ts:15
corsProxy: "/cors-proxy",  // Only works in production on Netlify
```

Error message:
```
Remote did not reply using the "smart" HTTP protocol. Expected "001e# service=git-upload-pack" but received: <!DOCTYPE html>
```

#### Why
The local development environment was trying to use Netlify's CORS proxy endpoint which is only available in production. This caused Git operations (clone, pull, push) to fail with CORS errors.

#### Changed
Updated Git configuration to use different CORS proxies based on environment:

```typescript:src/utils/git.ts:14-17
corsProxy: import.meta.env.DEV 
  ? "https://cors.isomorphic-git.org"  // Use public proxy in dev
  : "/cors-proxy",  // Use Netlify proxy in production
```

**Impact:**
- Fixed Git clone operations in development mode
- Maintained existing production behavior
- No breaking changes

**Files Changed:**
- `src/utils/git.ts`
