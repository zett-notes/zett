## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-27

### [CONF] Removed Herd and Set Up Clean Node.js Environment

#### Before
Old environment had Herd-injected configurations in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# Herd injected NVM configuration
export NVM_DIR="/Users/szymon/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm

[[ -f "/Applications/Herd.app/Contents/Resources/config/shell/zshrc.zsh" ]] && builtin source "/Applications/Herd.app/Contents/Resources/config/shell/zshrc.zsh"

# Herd injected PHP binary
export PATH="/Users/szymon/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin/":$PATH

# Herd injected PHP configurations
export HERD_PHP_83_INI_SCAN_DIR="/Users/szymon/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/83/"
export HERD_PHP_84_INI_SCAN_DIR="/Users/szymon/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/84/"
```

Node.js was installed in a non-standard location:
```
/Users/szymon/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/nvm/versions/node/v20.11.0/bin/node
```

#### Changes Made
1. Removed all Herd-related files and configurations:
   - `/Applications/Herd.app`
   - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/de.beyondco.herd.helper.plist`
   - `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/de.beyondco.herd.helper`
   - `~/Library/Application Support/Herd`
   - `~/Library/Caches/de.beyondco.herd`
   - `~/Library/HTTPStorages/de.beyondco.herd`
   - `~/Library/HTTPStorages/de.beyondco.herd.binarycookies`
   - `~/Library/Preferences/de.beyondco.herd.plist`
   - `~/Library/Saved Application State/de.beyondco.herd.savedState`
   - `~/Library/WebKit/de.beyondco.herd`

2. Cleaned up environment variables in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# NVM configuration
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

3. Installed latest NVM and Node.js:
```bash
# Installed NVM v0.40.1
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

# Installed Node.js LTS
nvm install 'lts/*'  # Installed v22.13.1 with npm v10.9.2
```

#### After
- Clean Node.js installation managed by NVM
- Node.js v22.13.1 with npm v10.9.2
- No remnants of Herd in the system

#### Testing
1. Verified NVM installation:
```bash
node -v  # v22.13.1
npm -v   # 10.9.2
```

### [SEC] Fixed Package Vulnerabilities and Dependencies

#### Before
Several security vulnerabilities were present in the project:
1. `katex` (0.12.0 - 0.16.20) - Moderate severity:
   - Issue: KaTeX \htmlData did not validate attribute names
   - CVE: GHSA-cg87-wmx4-v546

2. `nanoid` (<3.3.8) - Moderate severity:
   - Issue: Predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values
   - CVE: GHSA-mwcw-c2x4-8c55

Additionally, there were incorrect dependencies in package.json:
- Unused `cross-env` package

#### Changes Made
1. Updated vulnerable packages:
   - Updated `netlify-cli` to latest version, which includes the fixed version of `nanoid`
   - Updated `katex` to latest version

2. Cleaned up dependencies:
   - Removed unused `cross-env` package

#### After
- All known vulnerabilities have been resolved
- Package dependencies are clean and correctly specified
- No unused packages in dependencies

#### Testing
1. Verified no vulnerabilities remain:
```bash
npm audit  # Returns "found 0 vulnerabilities"
```

2. Verified all dependencies are correctly installed:
```bash
npm install  # All packages install correctly
```

#### Notes
- Regular security audits should be performed to catch new vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies clean and remove unused packages to reduce attack surface

### [FIX] Restored Original CORS Proxy Configuration from Lumen

#### Problem
Initially tried to set up a local CORS proxy for development, but this approach caused several issues:
1. Git operations (clone, pull, push) failing with 401 Unauthorized
2. Different behavior between development and production environments
3. Additional complexity with managing proxy process

#### Solution
After examining the original Lumen repository, discovered a simpler approach:
1. Use Netlify Edge Functions for CORS proxy in both development and production
2. Run development server with `netlify dev` to ensure Edge Functions work locally
3. Update git operations to use the correct proxy configuration

Changes made:
1. Fixed git operations in `git.ts`:
```typescript
const options = {
  fs,
  http,
  dir: REPO_DIR,
+ corsProxy: "/cors-proxy",  // Use Netlify Edge Function
+ remote: "origin",
  onAuth: () => ({ username: user.login, password: user.token }),
}
```

#### Impact
- Git operations work correctly in both development and production
- Development environment matches production environment exactly
- No need to manage separate proxy process
- Cleaner codebase with fewer dependencies

#### Lessons Learned
1. Always check reference implementation before making changes
2. Use consistent environment between development and production
3. Keep track of all required configuration options when modifying code
