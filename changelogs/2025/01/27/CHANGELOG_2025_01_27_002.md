## [0.1.6] - 2025-01-27

### [FIX] Fix Sign Out Functionality and App Name

#### Problem
1. Sign out was not working correctly - after signing out, the app would show an empty repo form instead of returning to the sign-in page
2. The app name was still showing as "Lumen" in the read-only mode message

#### Root Cause
1. The `useSignOut` hook was directly modifying `githubUserAtom` instead of letting the state machine handle the cleanup
2. Hard-coded "Lumen" text in `__root.tsx`

#### Changes Made

##### 1. Simplify Sign Out Logic
`src/hooks/use-sign-out.ts`:
```typescript
import { useSetAtom } from "jotai"
import { globalStateMachineAtom } from "../global-state"

export function useSignOut() {
  const send = useSetAtom(globalStateMachineAtom)
  return () => {
    send({ type: "SIGN_OUT" })
  }
}
```

The state machine already handles all cleanup on SIGN_OUT:
```typescript
signedOut: {
  entry: [
    "clearGitHubUser",
    "clearGitHubUserLocalStorage",
    "clearMarkdownFilesLocalStorage",
    "clearFileSystem",
    "setSampleMarkdownFiles",
  ],
  // ...
}
```

##### 2. Update App Name
`src/routes/__root.tsx`:
```tsx
<span className="sm:px-2">
  Zett is in <span className="italic">read-only</span> mode.
  <span className="hidden md:inline"> Sign in to start writing notes.</span>
</span>
```

#### Testing
1. Sign Out Flow:
   - Click "Sign Out" in settings
   - Should return to home page
   - Should see "Zett is in read-only mode" message
   - Should see "Sign In" button
   - Time: ~30s

2. State Reset:
   - After signing out, all user data should be cleared
   - Sample markdown files should be loaded
   - Time: ~30s

1. Original implementation in `lumen-notes/lumen`
